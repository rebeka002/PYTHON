Steganography - hiding text in audio file 

The first person to came with the idea of steganography was G.J. Simmons in 1983. In his formulation, two prisoners ALice and Bob are trying to sommunicate trying to make an escape plan from the prison. The prison is guarded by the wards which gives them very little possibilities to communicate without drawing an attention. By communicating over the public channel in such a way that ward doesn't notice anything unusual the create an escape plan. 
Therefore, the goal of the stegnography is not about hiding the content of secret message but the very existance of the secret message.

Audio steganography is a metod of hiding information within an audio signal. The interesting part of steganography is finding the modification where data are indistinguishable to the human ear considering Human Auditory System which is able of hearing high range of audible frequency.
